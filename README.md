## Quick Overview

The ChimpCheck repo comprises of three main components:

 * ChimpCombinator: The main scala library that implements the combinator library for generating Chimp tests and operations to run Chimp tests on Android emulators.

 * ChimpDriver: AndroidJUnit harness that integrates with ChimpCombinator. This is the code that is run by the Android emulator and executes event sequences as dictated by the Chimp test.

 * examples: A repository of sample apps to illustrate how ChimpCheck is on Android apps.
